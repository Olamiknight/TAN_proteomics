Rationale:
To help inform the qualitative histological tissue analysis, this project aims to use proteomic data from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) to observe differential neutrophil protein expression. It will also try classifying neutrophil subsets to assess whether they agree with the literature. Differences in the subsets found in this project could mean that more subset classifications are needed to describe neutrophil populations.
